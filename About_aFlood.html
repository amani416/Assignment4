			Hello! My name is Amani Flood. I'm a 20 year old student pursuing a degree in Digital Arts and Sciences at the University of Florida. I am proficient in Adobe Suite, Maya, and Pro Tools. As far as coding languages goes, I know C++, Java, Processing, and Assembly Code. I am also an expert in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. I am a quick learner and very adaptable. If needed, I could pick up another program or software relatively quickly. 

			<br>
			<br>

			I want to pursue a career in Digital Arts because I love the idea of creating an entire world of your own. I want to experience hands-on situations in a professional environment. I would be absolutely thrilled if I got the opportunity to intern for a company involved in this kind of work. Whether it be working on actual design projects or simply being an extra hand on deck, I would be completely content and excited. My main interest is to be in a setting that pertains to my major and I am eager to jump at every opportunity.
